# Cookie-Clicker-NHack
This is where my cookie clicker add-on “NHack” is located.

To use this, in your webbrowser type "javascript:[]" (don't use quotes)
Basically what this does is that whenever you press I don't know, like the q key, it asks you "How many cookies?"
The key things are Q, W, E, A, S, D.
Q: Asks how many cookies
W: Asks how many Heavenly Chips
E: Asks what building, then to upgrade that building or to get more of that building
A: Asks what stock, then how many of that stock
S: Asks how many Sugar Lumps
D: Does nothing
